What is Web application penetration testing?

Web application penetration testing is the practice of simulating attacks on a system in an attempt to gain access to sensitive data, with the purpose of determining whether a system is secure. These attacks are performed either internally or externally on a system, and they help provide information about the target system, identify vulnerabilities within them, and uncover exploits that could actually compromise the system. It is an essential health check of a system that informs testers whether remediation and security measures are needed.

What are the benefits of web application penetration testing?

There are several key benefits to incorporating web application penetration testing into a security program.

- It helps you satisfy compliance requirements. Pen testing is explicitly required in some industries, and performing web application pen testing helps meet this requirement.
- It helps you assess your infrastructure. Infrastructure, like firewalls and DNS servers, is public-facing. Any changes made to the infrastructure can make a system vulnerable. Web application pen testing helps identify real-world attacks that could succeed at accessing these systems.
- It identifies vulnerabilities. Web application pen testing identifies loopholes in applications or vulnerable routes in infrastructureâ€”before an attacker does.
- It helps confirm security policies. Web application pen testing assesses existing security policies for any weaknesses.
